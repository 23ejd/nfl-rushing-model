Linear Regression Model predicting NFL rushing yards, using data from the 2022-2023 NFL season. Source: PFR 

This project aimed to develop a model that could accurately predict rushing yards for NFL running backs, using RStudio and the R programming language. I created this model as a way to refine my understanding of concepts I learned in DS 1000 at Vanderbilt, including the use of ggplot, spread()/gather(), linear regression, cross-validation, etc. 

To set up the model, download the file and load into an RMarkdown file in RStudio. From there, you should be able to run the whole thing.
