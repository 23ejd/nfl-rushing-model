Linear Regression Model predicting NFL rushing yards, using data from the 2022-2023 NFL season. Source: PFR 

This project aimed to develop a model that could accurately predict rushing yards for NFL running backs, using RStudio and the R programming language. I created this model as a way to refine my understanding of concepts I learned in DS 1000 at Vanderbilt, including the use of ggplot, linear regression, cross-validation, etc. Additionally, I incorporated random forests and correlation testing. 

To view the project, download the file and load into an RMarkdown file in RStudio. From there, you should be able to run the whole thing.
